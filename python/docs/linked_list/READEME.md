# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 A singly linked list is associated number of references the node consist of. This singly linked list is a single reference
 points to the next node in a linked list.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The code challenge was to create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the
next Node. The instructions wanted a linked list to feature a created link list class to include a head property and by
upon instantiation, an empty linked list should be created. The classes should contain: insert Class(Head of list with
an O(1) Time performance. included Class(value exists as a Node's value within the list) and string Class(returns a string
representing all the values in the linked list as "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL")


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Approach efficiency is accomplished by implementing tests of each data structures, test_listed_list.py each step of the
way and rectify that test are passing in an appropriate manner.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
String
- the Class string implements a prints string representation of a full linked list class.

Insert
- The Class insert adds a new node to the head of the linked list

Includes
- Returns Ture if a given value is in the linked list and False otherwise.
