# Code Challenge: Movie Sort

## Author: Domaine Scully

### Overview

This file implements two specialized sorting functions that can sort movies alphabetically by title (excluding
leading A's, An's, or The's) or by year. The functions take a data structure which is a list of dictionaries. Each
dictionary represents movie data and includes a title, year, and genre key. The functions return a list of just the
titles.

### Functions

year_sort() - takes a list of movie dictionaries, returns a list of movie titles from most recent to least recent

title_sort() - takes a list of movie dictionaries, returns a list of movie titles in alphabetical order

### Run

python3 sorting/movie_sort/movie_sort.py

This command runs the two functions on a supplied list of movie dictionaries and outputs results to the console.
